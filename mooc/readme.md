# Java

## History of Java

Java is a general-purpose programming language that was originally developed by *James Gosling* and his team at Sun Microsystems in the early 1990s. The language was designed to be platform-independent, which means that code written in Java can run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

The language was initially called "Oak" because of the oak tree outside Gosling's office, but was later renamed to "Java" due to trademark issues.

Later “Oracle corp.” buys the “Sun Microsystem” in 2009
